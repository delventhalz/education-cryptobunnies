# Client

## Development

From this directory, 

```bash
npm install
npm build:dev
```

In another terminal instance,

```bash
npm run live-server
```

`live-server` will serve the frontend at http://localhost:8080.

You can also access the frontend at http://localhost:8000; this
instance will not have the automatic reload capability of
`live-server`.
