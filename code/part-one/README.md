This directory, if needed, is where the code for Part 1 of the sprint (intro sprint?) will be saved. This README.md is only acting as a placeholder and should be DELETED before the sprint is released.

If we do NOT have multiple parts, then we should put the sprint materials directly into `/code`, not `/code/part-one`.
