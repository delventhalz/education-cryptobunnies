## Lectures

In addition to reviewing the official Sawtooth documentation, watch the
Cryptomoji video lecture, which covers all the basics of Sawtooth application
development in detail. It is broken into five parts, the first of which is a
overview of blockchains generally, which you may have already watched in part
one. Each part is hosted by HackReactor on their YouTube channel:
